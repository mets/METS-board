A tutorial at iPres2021 by: Karin Bredenberg, Juha Lethonen and Tobias Steinke

## Abstract

This half day tutorial will provide participants with an introduction to the Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS) and the METS Primer which holds the description of all available elements. It will give a basic overview of the standard and explore different models of implementation. The METS schema is aiding the METS standard with the encoding of descriptive, administrative, and structural metadata regarding objects within a digital library as well as digital archives, and is expressed using the XML schema language of the World Wide Web Consortium. It is maintained by the METS Board and the METS Maintenance Activity is managed by the Library of Congress.
